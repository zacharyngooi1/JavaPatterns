Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces. A real life example could be a case of card reader which acts as an adapter between memory card and a laptop. You plugin the memory card into card reader and card reader into the laptop so that memory card can be read via laptop.
I found the example given in the below link quite confusing for beginners so i will implement one that is easier to follow.

in my example, i would want a samsung charger to make use of a adapter interface to charge all types of phones through the universal charger interface
